Here is a Python script that uses the `re` module for regular expressions to parse the Apache log data. The script also includes a function named `process_log_file` that processes a log file and outputs the parsed data as a JSON file.

```python
import re
import json

# Define the regex pattern for the log line
log_pattern = r'\[(.*?)\] \[(.*?)\] (.*?)(?: /etc/httpd/conf/workers2.properties)?'
log_regex = re.compile(log_pattern)

def parse_log_line(line):
    match = log_regex.match(line)
    if match:
        time, level, content = match.groups()
        return {
            'Time': time,
            'Level': level,
            'Content': content,
            'EventId': None,  # Not present in the sample log line
            'EventTemplate': None  # Not present in the sample log line
        }
    else:
        return None

def process_log_file(log_file_path, output_file_path):
    parsed_data = []
    with open(log_file_path, 'r') as log_file:
        for line in log_file:
            parsed_line = parse_log_line(line)
            if parsed_line:
                parsed_data.append(parsed_line)

    with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:
        json.dump(parsed_data, output_file)

# Example usage:
# process_log_file('apache.log', 'parsed_data.json')
```

This script assumes that the `EventId` and `EventTemplate` fields are not present in the log lines, as they are not present in the sample log line you provided. If these fields are present in your actual log data, you will need to adjust the regular expression and the `parse_log_line` function accordingly.
