Based on the log lines provided, here are the generalized log templates:

EventId	EventTemplate
E1	jk2_init() Found child <*> in scoreboard slot <*>
E2	mod_jk child workerEnv in error state <*>
E3	[client <*>] Directory index forbidden by rule: /var/www/html/
E4	workerEnv.init() ok /etc/httpd/conf/workers2.properties

Explanation:
- E1: This template represents the log lines where a child is found in a scoreboard slot. The child id and slot number are variable and replaced with `<*>`.
- E2: This template represents the log lines where the mod_jk child workerEnv is in an error state. The error state number is variable and replaced with `<*>`.
- E3: This template represents the log lines where a directory index is forbidden by rule for a specific client. The client IP address is variable and replaced with `<*>`.
- E4: This template represents the log lines where the workerEnv initialization is successful. This log line does not have any variable parts.
